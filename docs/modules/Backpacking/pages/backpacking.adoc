= Backpacking 

We choose gear that suits the individual backpacker. While we recognize that there are gear options out there that allow you to provide for multiple hikers (ie: tents, cookwear) we have chosen gear that focuses on hikers who plan to carry everything required for a solo backpacking trek.

The following gear selections are chosen for backpacking trips ranging between 2-7 nights.
